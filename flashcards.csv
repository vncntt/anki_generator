"What is Machine Learning (ML)?","An application of artificial intelligence where a machine learns from past experiences (input data) and makes future predictions."
"What are the three main categories of Machine Learning?","Supervised learning, Unsupervised learning, and Reinforcement learning."
"What is Supervised Learning?","A type of machine learning where the machine experiences examples along with labels or targets for each example. Used for classification and regression."
"What is Unsupervised Learning?","A type of machine learning where the system attempts to uncover patterns from unclassified and unlabeled data."
"What is Reinforcement Learning?","A type of machine learning where goal-oriented algorithms learn to attain a complex objective or maximize along a dimension over many steps, using reward feedback."
"What is Linear Regression?","A supervised learning technique to predict a real-value variable y from a given pattern X, where the output is a linear function of the input (yÌ‚ = WX+b)."
"What is the Gradient Descent Algorithm?","An iterative optimization algorithm used to find the minimum of a cost function by updating model parameters."
"What is Logistic Regression?","A supervised learning technique where the response variable describes the probability that the outcome is the positive case, constrained to the range {0,1}."
"What is Underfitting?","A scenario where the model has fewer features and is unable to learn from the data very well, resulting in high bias."
"What is Overfitting?","A scenario where the model has complex functions and fits the data too well, but is unable to generalize to predict new data, resulting in high variance."
